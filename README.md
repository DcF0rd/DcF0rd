# Hey, I'm Zach

**Student systems builder | Mythic strategist | DIY resilience advocate**

I’m learning by building — crafting modular tools that empower families, creators, and communities to reclaim autonomy. Every project is a mythic fragment of a larger system: practical, pivot-ready, and built to endure.

## Mythic Modules

Each tool below is part of the **Titanix ecosystem** — modular, open-source, and designed for real-world autonomy.

|   Tool Name        | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Prometheus: Titanix Edition** | Mythic OS concept — modular, resilient, and story-driven (like *Windows: 11*, but cooler) |
| **Hearthstream**    | Plex alternative with front-end + back-end, served via clean HTML interface |
| **ForgeConvert**    | Converts legacy media formats into modern, Plex-friendly files              |
| **EchoNex**         | Linux troubleshooting chatbot — think Clippy, but mythic                    |
| **VaultView**       | Standalone media player focused on file structure, with its own native window |

> *All tools are built with modular autonomy in mind — designed to run offline, adapt locally, and empower users.*

##  Mythic Philosophy
