### 👋 Hi, I'm Zachary Ford

I'm a hands-on developer and systems thinker based in Australia, focused on building **modular, offline-first tools** with real-world impact. I specialize in:

- 🧩 **Modular design & artifact-driven workflows**  
  Reusable components, scalable layouts, and reproducible engineering practices

- 🛠️ **Rapid prototyping & troubleshooting**  
  Especially with Eleventy, Tailwind, and PyQt6 for desktop tools

- 🧠 **Clear communication for technical audiences**  
  Translating abstract concepts into actionable visuals and docs

- 🔐 **Security-first development**  
  Offline-first architecture, local-first tools, and privacy-respecting design

- 🌱 **Community engagement & tech support**  
  Practical tools and transparent pricing for local ecosystems

Currently developing SnapDock — a lightweight markdown reader. Always open to collaboration, especially on reproducible workflows, minimal developer tools, and sovereign tech ecosystems.
